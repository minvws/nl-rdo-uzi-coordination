Multiple Authentication eXchange (MAX, formerly inge6) is build as a bridge between a OIDC client and a TVS (Toegang Verlenings Service). In this case the TVS could be DigiD or any other authentication method provider that is exposed through the [nl-uzi-login-controller](https://github.com/minvws/nl-uzi-login-controller). To clarify, this means that any authentication methods other than DigiD and DigiD Mock, will pass from MAX through the login controller. For DigiD, MAX allows an end-user to login there and provides the app with a token, which can be used to retrieve the BSN of that same end-user. This BSN can be used in different ways depending on your use case. For instance, it was used for the CoronaCheckApp [signing service](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-coronacheck-backend-bizrules-signing-service) to retrieve the related vaccination and test data from the existing provider. MAX is also capable of exchanging an encrypted BSN for properties from an external register. This functionality is used in this project, where it exchanges the BSN for data from the UZI register.

TL:DR; In simpler terms you can view MAX as the login manager" or a portal/gateway which offers you different options to login. These login flows are then handled elsewhere (read below about the login-controller).

## [nl-uzi-login-controller](https://github.com/minvws/nl-uzi-login-controller)

This repository connects to MAX (or rather vice versa) and handles any login methods that need custom work. In practice this means any login method except for DigiD (and DigiD Mock, since it returns a response from MAX directly. As explained above under "DigiD Mock - UZI testing Data".) For now, only the UZI card and Yivi login flows are handled here but more could be added.

## [nl-uzi-yivi-disclosure-web](https://github.com/minvws/nl-uzi-yivi-disclosure-web)

This is the front-end client. Written in PHP, Laravel. You can choose your login method of choice here on the /oidc/login route after which it will redirect you the nl-rdo-max repository. Then, after a successful login it will redirect you to the disclosure client screen. Here you can click a button to scan a QR code to add your data to a digital wallet app (Yivi). Yivi is briefly explained in the "Brief explanation" at the top of this readme. If it encounters an error, it will redirect back to the homepage with an error alert displayed there. Errors generated by the front-end, will be saved in a file called `laravel.log`.

## [nl-uzipoc-register-api](https://github.com/minvws/nl-uzipoc-register-api)

For testing purposes a mock UZI register has been built to make it possible to log in with UZI cards locally. Otherwise, using the actual register requires you to ask the CIBG to insert your UZI ID into that register for every card. With the nl-uzipoc-register-api repository, there is a drop-in replacement for local development.


## [nl-rdo-uzi-coordination](https://github.com/minvws/nl-rdo-uzi-coordination)

This coordination repository is for explaining, managing and coordinating test efforts for the project Toekomstbestendig maken UZI. This documentation also provides step-by-step instructions on how to get up and running setting up the uzi repositories. By following these guidelines, you have a structured way of contributing to the project.
